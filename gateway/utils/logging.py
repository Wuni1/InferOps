"""
InferOps - Logging Configuration

This module sets up structured logging for the gateway application.
Using structured logs (e.g., in JSON format) makes it much easier to
parse, search, and analyze logs in a production environment with tools
like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk.
