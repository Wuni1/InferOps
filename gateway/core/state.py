"""
InferOps - Core Application State

This module manages the shared, in-memory state of the InferOps cluster.
It includes caches for node statuses, job information, and active alerts.

In a production, multi-instance deployment of the gateway, this in-memory storage
would be replaced by a distributed caching solution like Redis or an in-memory data grid
to ensure state consistency across all gateway instances.
